## 1. What Is This Kit?

This kit gives AI coding agents the **context, skills, memory, and workflows** to act as a reliable software engineering team. It solves **Another Lethal Trifecta** of agentic AI:

- **Velocity mismatch** — agents code faster than humans can review, skipping critical steps
- **Non-determinism** — same prompt, different output every time without guardrails
- **Cost asymmetry ("context rot")** — wrong architectural decisions compound and become exponentially expensive to fix
- **Self-Evolution**: Agents rewrite their own prompts (`meta-optimize`) to fix recurring errors.
- **Adaptive Orchestration**: Loki Mode dynamically injects research/safety phases based on complexity.
- **Vibe Coding**: Translates high-level aesthetic intents ("Make it pop") into concrete CSS/JS.

The kit enforces **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**, **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **Architecture-Driven Development (ADD)**, and structured **human-in-the-loop checkpoints** — so agents build correct, secure, maintainable software the first time.

**Universal Skill Compiler:** The `scripts/init.py` script automatically configures skills for your specific tool:
- **VS Code / Copilot**: Generates slash commands (e.g. `/code-review`).
- **Cursor**: Generates optimized `.mdc` rules.
- **Claude Code**: Enables native skill discovery.
- **Antigravity / Gemini**: Wires up `.gemini/settings.json`.

**Compatible with:** Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, any tool reading markdown context files.

**Repositories using this kit should see reduction in agent runtime and token usage** through explicit context, cached decisions, and SDLC memory.

## 2. Brain Mode

> **"Meta-Cognitive Orchestrator"**

The system features a **Brain Mode** that supersedes standard execution. It uses **Active Inference** to minimize project risk and intelligently routes tasks to local and remote models.

```bash
# Activate Brain Mode
/brain activate "Build a SaaS platform"
```

### Key Capabilities
- **Active Inference Loop**: Continuously compares "Expected State" vs "Actual State".
- **Dynamic Cost Routing**: Routes simple tasks to **Local LLMs** and complex ones to **Remote SOTA Models**.
- **Episodic Memory**: Learns from past failures and successes across projects.

Read more in [AGENTS.md](../agents/AGENTS.md).

---

## 3. Quick Start (5 min)

```bash
# 1. Run the Interactive Setup Wizard
python3 scripts/init.py
```

**2. Feed the Mission**
   - The script generates `BOOTSTRAP_MISSION.md` (or `SETUP_MISSION.md` if dynamic setup is disabled) in your root.
   - **Copy its content** and paste it into your AI Agent's chat window.
   - This aligns the agent with your project context immediately.

**3. Verify Context**
   - Open `agents/AGENTS.md` and check the `Tech Stack` section.
   - Open `agents/CONSTITUTION.md` and review project rules.

**4. Git Tracking (Important)**
   - To keep the initial structure of `agents/memory/` and `project/` in your repository but prevent Git from tracking the continuous autonomous modifications your agents will make to them locally, run:
     ```bash
     git ls-files agents/memory/ project/ | xargs git update-index --skip-worktree
     ```

## 3.1. GABBE CLI (experimental)

The core of GABBE 2.0 is the **Zero-Dependency CLI** (`gabbe`) which powers the "Hybrid Mode". It bridges the gap between flexible Markdown files and a robust SQLite database.
It's an experimental work-in-progress and you can do without the whole package only with the rest of the kit.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- **LLM API Key**: For Brain/Route features, set `GABBE_API_KEY` (OpenAI-compatible).

**Environment Variables** (full reference in [CLI_REFERENCE.md](CLI_REFERENCE.md#environment-variables)):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GABBE_API_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `GABBE_API_KEY` | *(required for LLM features)* | Bearer token for the LLM API |
| `GABBE_API_MODEL` | `gpt-4o` | Model name sent in API requests |
| `GABBE_LLM_TEMPERATURE` | `0.7` | Sampling temperature (0.0–1.0) |
| `GABBE_LLM_TIMEOUT` | `30` | HTTP timeout in seconds |
| `GABBE_ROUTE_THRESHOLD` | `50` | Complexity score above which prompts route REMOTE |
| `GABBE_MAX_COST_USD` | `5.0` | Maximum cost (USD) budget per run |
| `GABBE_MAX_TOKENS_PER_RUN` | `100000` | Maximum token limit per run |
| `GABBE_OTEL_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable OpenTelemetry tracing |

### Installation
The CLI is a Python package.

```bash
# 1. Install locally (Recommended)
pip install -e .

# 2. Verify installation
gabbe --help
```

### Core Commands
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `gabbe init` | Initialize the SQLite Database (Run this after `python scripts/init.py`). |
| `gabbe sync` | **Hybrid Sync**: Bidirectional sync between `project/TASKS.md` and SQLite DB. |
| `gabbe verify`| **Enforcer**: programmable integrity check (files, tests, lint). |
| `gabbe status`| **Dashboard**: Visualizes project phase and task progress. |
| `gabbe brain` | **Meta-Cognition**: Activates Active Inference loop or Evolutionary Prompt Optimization (Requires API Key). |
| `gabbe route` | **Cost Router**: Arbitrates between Local and Remote LLMs based on task complexity (Requires API Key). |
| `gabbe forecast`| **Strategic Forecast**: Projects remaining work cost and tokens based on historical run data. |
| `gabbe serve-mcp` | **MCP Gateway**: Zero-dependency JSON-RPC Model Context Protocol server for standalone agents to access tools safely. |

### Platform Control Layer
The experimental `gabbe` CLI supports a **platform control layer**. It covers budget enforcement, cost and token controls, hard stops, policy rules, the tool gateway, audit tracing, human escalation, and deterministic replay. Detailed documentation is available in [`PLATFORM_CONTROLS.md`](PLATFORM_CONTROLS.md).

### Architecture
GABBE 2.0 uses a **Hybrid Architecture** where agents and humans interact via Markdown, but the system of record is SQLite.

```

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 0 — Strategy (Optional)**
```
Tell agent: "Use business-case/strategy skills to validate the goals."
Agent produces: BUSINESS_CASE.md or EMPATHY_MAP.md or similar strategy docs
You review: The 'Why' and the 'Who' before moving to 'What'
Approve: "Approved. Move to Step 1 Requirements."
```

**Step 1 — Requirements (S01)**
```
Tell agent: "Use spec-writer skill. Build [your goal]."
Agent produces: PRD.md using EARS syntax (templates/product/PRD_TEMPLATE.md)
You review: Check that all requirements are verifiable predicates
Approve: "Approved. Create SDLC checkpoint S01."
```

**Step 2 — Design (S02)**
```
Agent produces: PLAN.md + C4 architecture diagram + ADRs for major decisions
Agent runs: threat-model.skill for any auth/data storage features
You review: Architecture decisions, data flow, security mitigations
Approve: "Approved. Create SDLC checkpoint S02."
```

**Step 3 — Specification & Tasks (S03/S04)**
```
Agent produces: SPEC_TEMPLATE.md with API contracts + TASKS_TEMPLATE.md
Each task must: Be achievable in ~15 minutes, have testable acceptance criteria
You review: Coverage of all PRD requirements in tasks
Approve: "Approved. Create SDLC checkpoints S03 and S04."
```

**Step 4 — Implementation Loop (S05)**
```
For each task, agent:
  1. Reads task + AGENTS.md + CONTINUITY.md (past failures)
  2. Detects knowledge gaps → invokes research.skill if needed
  3. Writes failing test FIRST (TDD Red)
  4. Implements minimal code to pass test (TDD Green)
  5. Refactors while keeping tests green (TDD Refactor)
  6. Runs: tests + lint + typecheck + agentic-linter boundary check
  7. Logs to AUDIT_LOG.md
  8. Marks task DONE in project/TASKS.md
```

**Steps 5-10 — Quality, Security, Deploy**
```
Tell agent: "Run integrity-check skill" → 8-dimension verification
Tell agent: "Run security-audit and compliance-review skills" → OWASP checks + compliance checks
You review code → Human approval → Staging deploy → Production
```

### First-Time Setup on Existing Project

```bash
# 1. Copy kit to project root
cp -r ~/agents/ ./

# 2. Wire up context
agents/setup-context.sh

# 3. Adapt AGENTS.md
#    - Set tech stack, test commands, lint commands
#    - Add existing architecture constraints
#    - Document known tech debt areas

# 4. Initialize memory
#    Agent: "Initialize project memory. Run integrity-check skill on current codebase."
```

### Bug Fix Flow (step-by-step)

```
1. Fill templates/core/BUG_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md with reproduction steps
2. Tell agent: "Use debug skill. Bug: [description]. BUG_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md is filled."
3. Agent: reproduces → root cause → writes FAILING TEST first
4. Agent: implements fix → verifies test is now GREEN
5. Agent: runs full test suite (no regressions), lint, typecheck
6. Agent: logs to AUDIT_LOG.md, creates git-workflow PR
7. You: review PR
```

### Tech Debt Flow (step-by-step)

```
1. Tell agent: "Use tech-debt skill on [directory or whole project]."
2. Agent: scans for TODOs, complexity > 10, duplication, stale deps
3. Agent: fills TECH_DEBT_TEMPLATE.md with Impact×Effort matrix
4. You: review and prioritize the backlog
5. Tell agent: "Refactor [debt item] using refactor skill. Keep all tests green."
6. Agent: runs agentic-linter after each refactor to verify boundaries

## 26. Troubleshooting

**Agent ignores AGENTS.md:**
- Run `setup-context.sh` to create tool-specific symlinks
- For Cursor: verify `.cursorrules` file exists (symlink created by setup script)
- For Claude Code: verify `.claude/CLAUDE.md` exists

**Agent repeats past mistakes:**
- Check `agents/memory/CONTINUITY.md` — past failures should be logged here
- Tell agent: "Read CONTINUITY.md before starting. What past mistakes are recorded?"

**Tests always pass immediately (false positive):**
- `tdd-cycle.skill` includes a false-positive check: if test passes with no implementation, the test is wrong
- Tell agent: "The test passed immediately — that means the test is broken. Fix the test to actually fail first."

**Agent uses deprecated APIs:**
- Activate Context-7 MCP: it provides up-to-date SDK docs to prevent this
- Add to AGENTS.md Research Policy: "Always use Context-7 MCP before calling any library method"

**Session lost after interruption:**
- Tell agent: "Use session-resume skill to load all memory and continue."
- All memory is stored in `agents/memory/` — it persists across sessions

**Agent makes architecture decisions without asking:**
- Add to AGENTS.md Human-in-the-Loop section: "Architecture changes require human approval"
- Check `CONSTITUTION.md` — Article VII should cover this

**Context window too large / slow responses:**
- Use `context_cost: low` skills for routine tasks
- Activate Loki Mode: specialized personas have smaller, focused context scopes
