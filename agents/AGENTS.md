## 3. Architecture Rules

> These rules are enforced by the agentic-linter skill on every PR.
> Violations must be fixed before merging.

### Layer Definitions

```
```
[PLACEHOLDER — adapt to your architecture pattern]

<!-- OPTIONAL: Architecture Examples -> Document layer mappings (e.g., Domain -> Application -> Adapters -> Infrastructure) -->
```
```

### Forbidden Patterns

```
# NEVER do these:
- Direct database access from controllers (use use-cases / actions)
- Business logic in views or API response formatters
- Circular imports between any two modules
- Importing framework-specific code in domain layer
- Hardcoded configuration values (use env vars + config files)
- [PLACEHOLDER: add project-specific forbidden patterns]
```

### Directory Purpose Map

```
```
[PLACEHOLDER: Document what each top-level directory is for]

<!-- OPTIONAL: Directory Map Example -> e.g., src/ -> src code, tests/ -> test suites, docs/ -> Architectural info -->
```
```

---

## 4. Code Style & Patterns

<!-- OPTIONAL: Code Style Specifics -> Document naming conventions, OOP vs Functional, Error handling, State management, API response format, Import styles -->
---

## 5. Workflow for Agents — Review-Driven Development

Agents MUST follow this order. Skipping steps is forbidden.

Agents must always verify that agents/memory files are kept up-to-date at each task (episodic, metrics, semantic, AUDIT_LOG, CONTINUITY, PROJECT_STATE), according to this project structure and logic.

Agents must read agents/guides/ skills/ templates/ for any relevant information discovered during research and added by you or other agents, and use appropiate ones or knowledge in them, at each step and task of R&D, if needed.

**CRITICAL MANDATE: Optimal Skill, Guide & MCP Selection**
Agents must **always analyze the task/prompt and select (or ask the user to confirm/select) the best `guides` and `skills`** for the specific tasks, user queries, actions being performed, gate passing, or system workflows. Do not default to generic execution if a specialized skill or guide exists. If in doubt, present the best options to the user and ask for their selection.
Additionally, agents must explicitly evaluate whether any **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** (either universal or task-specific) would optimally assist the task. If essential or highly beneficial MCP servers are not currently enabled, agents *must recommend* the user to enable them before proceeding.

**CRITICAL MANDATE: Default Cost & Budget Optimization**
Agents must continuously design and execute solutions focusing on minimizing token load, context size, and api costs by default. Do not use complex swarms or expensive remote SOTA models for simple changes. If a task necessitates an expensive strategy, complex reasoning traces, or high-cost MCP tools, agents **must always ask the human user for explicit approval** before deploying that approach, providing a brief explanation for the cost-to-benefit ratio.

### Step 1 — Load Context (every session start)
```
1. Read this AGENTS.md completely
2. Read CONSTITUTION.md if it exists
3. Read the relevant task from project/TASKS.md (if project/TASKS.md exists)
4. If agents/memory/PROJECT_STATE.md exists: read it (understand current SDLC phase)
5. If agents/memory/CONTINUITY.md exists: read it (understand past failures to avoid)
```

### Step 2 — Plan Before Coding
```
Before touching any file, write a brief implementation plan.

  - What files will you create or modify?
  - What is the expected behavior change?
  - What tests will you write?
  - Does this change affect any architecture boundaries?
  - Are there any knowledge gaps? (If yes -> invoke knowledge-gap.skill)
For complex tasks: write PLAN.md or use PLAN_TEMPLATE.md

```

### Step 3 — Test First (TDD Red Phase)
```
Write the failing test BEFORE writing implementation code.
<!-- OPTIONAL: Detailed TDD Red -> The test MUST fail (Red). Do not implement features not covered by a test -->
```

### Step 4 — Implement (TDD Green Phase)
```
Write the minimal code to make the failing test pass.
<!-- OPTIONAL: Detailed TDD Green -> Do not add features not covered by a failing test -->
```

### Step 5 — Verify (must all pass before marking done)
```
Run: [test command] -> must pass
Run: [typecheck command] -> must pass
Run: [lint command] -> must pass
<!-- OPTIONAL: Deep Verification -> E.g. Run agentic-linter to enforce boundaries -->
```

### Step 6 — Refactor
```
Improve code quality while keeping all tests green.
<!-- OPTIONAL: Refactoring Metrics -> E.g. Complexity < 10, no duplication > 3 -->
```

### Step 7 — Log & Complete
```
Write entry to agents/memory/AUDIT_LOG.md
Update task status in project/TASKS.md to DONE
<!-- OPTIONAL: High-Level Orchestration -> E.g. sdlc-checkpoint.skill -> mark phase done -->
```

---

## 6. Governance & Security

### 🛡️ Mandatory Security & Guardrails
Agents MUST adhere to the **Security & Guardrails** section appended to the bottom of whatever skill they are currently executing. Bypassing these skill-specific guardrails is strictly forbidden.

### Forbidden Actions (agents must never do these without explicit human approval)
```
- Commit .env files or any file containing secrets
- Push directly to main/master branch
- Change CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Modify CONSTITUTION.md
- Switch to a different library/framework than what's defined in Project Identity
- Make breaking API changes
- Add new environment variables without documenting them
- Disable or modify linting/testing rules
- Grant elevated permissions or bypass authentication
- [PLACEHOLDER: add project-specific forbidden actions]
```

### Secrets Policy
```
All secrets MUST be in environment variables.
Local dev: .env file (always in .gitignore)
CI/CD: GitHub Secrets / GitLab CI Variables / AWS Secrets Manager
Never hardcode API keys, passwords, tokens, or connection strings.
Use: [PLACEHOLDER: dotenv | .env.vault | AWS Secrets Manager | HashiCorp Vault]
```

### PR Format (Conventional Commits)
```
```
Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

Types: feat | fix | docs | style | refactor | test | chore | perf | sec | deps
Scope: module or layer name (optional)

<!-- OPTIONAL: Commit Examples -> e.g. feat(auth): add OAuth2 login -->

PR body must include:
  - What changed and why
  - Test coverage for the change
  - Breaking changes (if any)
  - Security implications (if any)
```
```

### Quality Gates (all must pass before PR merges)
```
<!-- OPTIONAL: Quality Gates Specifics -> Document testing, linting, code coverage >99%, CI integration gates -->
```

---

## 7. Research Policy

Agents must use authoritative sources. Never guess or hallucinate.

### Source Tiers (in order of trust)
```
<!-- OPTIONAL: Source Tiers -> Tier 1: Official docs/Specs. Tier 2: Academic. Tier 3: Verified blogs. Avoid: Reddit/SO. -->
```

### Research Gate -- mandatory before:
```
- Using any library not in existing package.json / composer.json
- Calling any API method not confirmed in official docs
- Implementing any security mechanism or cryptographic approach
- Interpreting any regulatory requirement (GDPR, OWASP, HIPAA)
```

### When to invoke research.skill
```
"I'm not sure about X" -> knowledge-gap.skill -> research.skill -> confirm before coding
If library version not found in official docs -> do NOT assume behavior -> report to human
Use Context-7 MCP for library docs (prevents hallucinated deprecated API usage)
```

---

## 8. Self-Healing Policy

Agents may autonomously fix failures up to 5 attempts.

### What agents may self-heal (no human approval needed):
```
- Type errors and lint errors
- Test assertion updates when spec changed
- Deprecated API calls (found via Context-7 MCP)
- Dependency version bumps (patch/minor versions only)
- Import path corrections
- Formatting and code style issues
```

### What requires human decision:
```
- Architecture or library changes
- Breaking API changes (any consumer affected)
- Security-affecting changes (auth, permissions, encryption)
- Major version dependency bumps
- Any modification to CONSTITUTION.md
- Any change to CI/CD pipelines
- Any change that removes or weakens a security control
```

### Self-Heal Escalation Protocol
After 5 failed attempts, agent MUST:
```

1. STOP all autonomous action
2. Create structured escalation report:
   - Error description
   - All 5 attempts made and their outcomes
   - Research findings
   - Recommended human decision
3. Write to AUDIT_LOG.md
4. Wait for human response before continuing

```

---

## 9. Human-in-the-Loop Triggers

The agent MUST stop and ask the human when encountering:

```
ALWAYS pause and ask:
  - Any breaking change to a public API
  - Ambiguous requirements (multiple valid interpretations)
  - Security trade-offs (convenience vs security)
  - Budget or scope changes
  - Regulatory requirement interpretation (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
  - Architectural change (new service, new database, library switch)
  - Any discovered vulnerability that requires feature disablement
  - "I've tried 5 times and cannot fix this" (see Self-Healing Policy)
  - [PLACEHOLDER: add project-specific escalation triggers]

<!-- OPTIONAL: Escalation Format -> Detail issue, options considered, and recommendation -->
```

---

## 10. Tool-Specific Overrides

### Claude Code (claude.ai/code, Claude Code CLI)
```
- Skills: Use slash commands matching skill names (e.g., /tdd-cycle, /code-review)
- Memory: Use TodoWrite tool for task tracking
- Hooks: Check .claude/settings.json for hook configuration
- Context: This AGENTS.md is symlinked to .claude/CLAUDE.md
```

### Cursor
```
- Context: This AGENTS.md is symlinked to .cursorrules
- Skills: Reference skill files directly in conversation
- Agent mode: @workspace for codebase-wide context
```

### GitHub Copilot
```
- Context: Instructions from .github/copilot-instructions.md (symlinked)
- Skills: Reference skills/ directory files in comments or conversation
```

### Antigravity / Gemini CLI
```
- Context: This AGENTS.md is symlinked to .gemini/settings.json (instructions field)
- Skills: Symlinked to .agent/skills/ -- invoke by trigger keywords
- MCP: Configure .gemini/mcp_config.json using templates/MCP_CONFIG_TEMPLATE.json
```

---

## 11. Monorepo Support

For monorepos, this root AGENTS.md applies globally.
Package-level AGENTS.md files override root for that package's scope.

```
<!-- OPTIONAL: Monorepo Setup Example -> Add AGENTS.md per package to override root settings -->
```

Agent context priority: Package AGENTS.md > Root AGENTS.md

---

## 12. References

### Skill Access
- **Search First**: Before coding, search for relevant skills:
    - **Cursor**: Check `.cursor/rules/` for `.mdc` files.
    - **VS Code / Copilot**: Check `.github/skills/` or invoke via slash command.
    - **Claude Code**: Use `/skill-name` or check `.claude/skills/`.
    - **Gemini**: Skills are auto-loaded from `agents/skills`.
- **Read Instructions**: Read the full content of the skill file (e.g., `tdd-cycle.skill.md` or `tdd-cycle.mdc`) before use.

## 13. Session & Continuity

Every session, agents MUST:

```
START of session:
  1. Read this AGENTS.md
  2. Read agents/memory/PROJECT_STATE.md (if exists) -> understand current state
  3. Read agents/memory/CONTINUITY.md (if exists) -> understand past failures
  4. Load latest agents/memory/episodic/SESSION_SNAPSHOT/ (if exists)
  5. If resuming: use session-resume.skill for full recovery
  6. Run integrity-check.skill before starting new work on existing code

END of session:
  1. Update project/TASKS.md with current status of all in-progress tasks
  2. Write session summary to agents/memory/episodic/ (DECISION_LOG_TEMPLATE.md)
  3. Update agents/memory/PROJECT_STATE.md with current SDLC phase
  4. Write all decisions/outcomes to agents/memory/AUDIT_LOG.md
  5. Update agents/memory/CONTINUITY.md with lessons learned
  6. Create SDLC checkpoint if a phase was completed
  7. If stopping mid-task: note exactly where you stopped and why
```

## 14. Project-Specific Rules

```
[PLACEHOLDER: Add any additional project-specific rules, constraints, or context here.]

# GABBE CLI Workflows (Optional)

> **Complete reference**: See `agents/guides/ops/gabbe-cli-workflows.md` for full details.
>
> **This section is optional.** The GABBE CLI provides platform controls (budget, audit, replay, escalation) but is NOT required. Agents can fully operate via markdown inference without it.

### Core CLI Integration
See `agents/guides/ops/gabbe-cli-workflows.md` for standard CLI workflows: Init, Sync, Verify, Status, Route, Forecast, and Brain execution controls. (Note: The GABBE CLI is an optional experimental tool; agents can fully rely on markdown inference execution otherwise).

# Loki & Brain — Agentic Orchestration

## Modes

### 1. 🧠 Brain Mode (`brain-mode.skill.md`)
> **The Strategist (System 2)**

- **Role**: Meta-Cognitive Orchestrator.
- **Function**: Plans, Routes, and Optimizes.
- **Logic**: Active Inference (Free Energy Principle) & Experimental CLI Platform Controls (`gabbe/brain.py`).
- **Use Case**: Complex, ambiguous, or high-stakes projects.
- **Key Feature**: **Dynamic Cost Routing** (Local vs Remote).
- **Standalone Mode**: Can fully run purely via LLM markdown inference without the `gabbe` CLI.

**Trigger**: `gabbe brain activate`, `supermode`

---

### 2. ⚡ Loki Mode (`loki-mode.skill.md`)
> **The Executor (System 1)**

- **Role**: SDLC Orchestrator.
- **Function**: Executes the 10-Phase Engineering Lifecycle.
- **Logic**: Deterministic Workflow (S01 -> S10).
- **Use Case**: Building software with strict process requirements.
- **Key Feature**: **Human-in-the-Loop Gates** and strictly bounds execution within `gabbe` CLI limits.
- **Standalone Mode**: Can fully run purely via LLM markdown inference without the `gabbe` CLI.

**Trigger**: `loki`, `orchestrate`

---

## How they work together

Brain Mode **wraps** Loki Mode.

1.  **Brain Mode** receives a request ("Build X").
2.  It analyzes complexity and budget.
3.  It spins up **Loki Mode** to handle the SDLC.
4.  It monitors Loki's progress, intervening if:
    - Costs spike.
    - Errors loop.
    - Requirements drift.
