# Cost Optimization & FinOps Guide

## Overview
Financial Operations (FinOps) is the operating model for the cloud, bringing financial accountability to the variable spend model of cloud computing. This guide provides the philosophical and technical strategies to maximize business value from your architecture.

## Principles of FinOps
1. **Teams need to collaborate**: Finance, engineering, and product teams must work together in near-real time.
2. **Decisions are driven by business value**: Unit economics (e.g., cost per transaction, cost per user) drive decisions, not just aggregate spend.
3. **Everyone takes ownership**: Engineers are responsible for the costs their architectures generate.
4. **Data must be accessible and timely**: Feedback loops on cost must be immediate to allow for quick corrections.

## Architectural Strategies for Cost Optimization

| Strategy | Description | Implementation Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Right-Sizing** | Continuously matching instance types and sizes to workload performance and capacity requirements. | Use predictive scaling; downsize underutilized EC2/RDS instances; utilize ARM-based instances (like Graviton). |
| **Commitment Discounts** | Utilizing financial instruments for baseline loads. | Reserved Instances (RIs), Savings Plans, committed use discounts. |
| **Auto-Scaling & Elasticity** | Matching provisioned resources dynamically to actual demand. | Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), scaling down non-prod environments off-hours. |
| **Serverless Architectures** | Paying strictly for execution time rather than idle capacity. | Adopting AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Cloud Run, DynamoDB (On-Demand). |
| **Storage Tiering** | Moving data to cheaper storage classes based on access frequency. | S3 Lifecycle policies (Standard -> Infrequent Access -> Glacier). |
| **Spot Instances** | Using surplus compute capacity at steep discounts for fault-tolerant workloads. | Running stateless background workers, CI/CD pipelines, or big-data processing on Spot. |

## The FinOps Lifecycle
1. **Inform**: Visibility and allocation. Implement strict resource tagging schemas. Showback/chargeback to specific business units.
2. **Optimize**: Identify specific optimizations (rightsizing, spot usage, terminating zombies).
3. **Operate**: Automate the FinOps practices. Build continuous checks into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Automation & Agentic Checks
Use the `cost-optimization.skill.md` to autonomously:
- Generate `COST_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Analyze IaC (Terraform/CloudFormation) for untagged resources or over-provisioned defaults.
- Recommend architectural shifts (e.g., "This cron job runs 24/7 on EC2; moving to Serverless framework will save 80%").
- Audit AI/LLM costs using the [Performant AI Skill](../../skills/coding/performant-ai.skill.md).
