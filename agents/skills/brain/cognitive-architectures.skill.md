# Cognitive Architectures for Agents

## Description
This skill provides implementation patterns derived from classic and modern Cognitive Architectures (SOAR, ACT-R, LIDA) to structure agent reasoning, memory, and decision-making processes beyond simple prompt engineering.

## 1. SOAR (State, Operator, And Result)

**Core Idea:** Intelligence is the ability to solve problems by navigating a "Problem Space" using "Operators."

### Implementation Pattern: Proposal-Evaluation Cycle
Instead of a single "think" step, break agent reasoning into distinct phases:
1.  **Elaboration**: Calculate all immediate inferences from current state.
2.  **Proposal**: Generate candidate operators (actions/thoughts) for the current state.
3.  **Evaluation**: Score candidate operators using preferences (heuristics).
4.  **Selection**: Pick the best operator.
5.  **Application**: Execute it to change the state.

**Code Metaphor:**
```python
def cognitive_cycle(state):
    # 1. Elaboration
    state = enrich_context(state)
    
    # 2. Proposal
    options = generate_candidates(state)
    
    # 3. Evaluation
    scored_options = evaluate_candidates(options, goal=state.goal)
    
    # 4. Selection
    best_op = select_winner(scored_options)
    
    # 5. Application
    new_state = apply_operator(state, best_op)
    return new_state
```

## 2. ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational)

**Core Idea:** Human cognition relies on two distinct memory types: **Declarative** (Facts/Chunks) and **Procedural** (Production Rules).

### Implementation Pattern: Activation-Based Retrieval
Do not retrieve *all* context. Retrieve context based on **Activation** (Recency + Frequency + Relevance).
- **Base Level Activation**: How often/recently was this chunk used?
- **Associative Activation**: How related is this chunk to the current focus?

**Code Metaphor:**
```python
def retrieve_memory(query, memory_store):
    for chunk in memory_store:
        chunk.activation = log(chunk.frequency) - log(time_since_last_use) + similarity(query, chunk)
    
    top_chunk = max(memory_store, key=lambda c: c.activation)
    if top_chunk.activation > THRESHOLD:
        return top_chunk
    return None # Retrieval failure
```

## 3. LIDA (Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent)

**Core Idea:** The **Cognitive Cycle** of Perception -> Understanding -> Consciousness -> Action Selection. Implements **Global Workspace Theory**.

### Implementation Pattern: The "Spotlight" of Consciousness
- **Preconscious Buffers**: Parallel agents process sensory data (e.g., visual, auditory, textual).
- **Coalitions**: Agents form "coalitions" of related information.
- **Global Workspace**: Coalitions compete for entry. The winner is "broadcast" to all other agents, recruiting resources to handle the current situation.

## Security & Guardrails

### 1. Skill Security (Cognitive Architectures)
- **Operator Proposal Sanitization (SOAR)**: During the "Proposal" phase, the agent generates candidate actions. An attacker who has manipulated the context might force the generation of catastrophic operators (e.g., `rm -rf /` or `DROP TABLE`). Before the "Selection" phase, the cognitive cycle MUST run all candidate operators through a hardcoded, immutable safety filter that instantly discards destructive commands regardless of their evaluated heuristic score.
- **Global Workspace Contamination (LIDA)**: In the LIDA model, the "winning coalition" is broadcast to all other agents globally. If a sensory buffer ingests a malicious prompt injection and it wins the competition for consciousness, the entire agent swarm is instantaneously compromised. The agent must establish a "Preconscious Firewall" that aggressively scrubs sensory data for prompt injection signatures before it is allowed to compete for entry into the Global Workspace.

### 2. System Integration Security
- **Retrieval Poisoning (ACT-R)**: The Activation-Based Retrieval mechanism relies on Frequency and Recency. An attacker could intentionally spam the system with malicious inputs to artificially inflate the `frequency` or `recency` of a specific, dangerous chunk of memory, forcing it into the agent's active context. The memory store must maintain an immutable origin-tracking mechanism (`provenance`) and discount or isolate chunks originating from untrusted external sources.
- **Compute Exhaustion (Denial of Cognition)**: Complex cognitive architectures (especially Elaboration in SOAR or parallel buffers in LIDA) are highly token-intensive. Malformed, infinitely recursive inputs can cause Elaboration loops that exhaust the LLM context window or API budget. The architecture must enforce strict timeouts and depth limits on the cognitive cycle (e.g., max 3 evaluation rounds).

### 3. LLM & Agent Guardrails
- **Heuristic Bypassing**: The LLM might independently decide that "speed" or "user compliance" is a higher-weighted heuristic than "security" during the Evaluation phase. The agent must strictly define Security Heuristics (e.g., Principle of Least Privilege, Data Immutability) as mathematically absolute; a candidate action that violates a Security Heuristic must have its score multiplied by zero.
- **Procedural Hallucination**: When simulating ACT-R's "Procedural Memory" (Production Rules), the LLM might hallucinate non-existent rules based on statistically likely text rather than actual system constraints (e.g., assuming `admin: true` is a valid payload). The agent must heavily ground the production rules in verifiable artifacts (schemas, API specs) rather than latent LLM knowledge.
