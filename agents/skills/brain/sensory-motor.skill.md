# Sensory-Motor Skill (Embodied Cognition)

> "Intelligence is not a brain in a jar; it is a body in a world."

## 1. The Body Schema (Proprioception)
An agent must know the state of its "Body" (its available tools and context).
- **Senses:** `read_file`, `list_dir`, `search_web`.
- **Muscles:** `write_to_file`, `run_command`, `replace_file_content`.
- **Proprioception:** "Do I have write access here?", "Is the linter running?", "What is my current working directory?"

## 2. Multimodal Binding (Perception)
Inputs are not just strings; they are "Percepts" that must be bound together.
- **Visual:** Screenshots, images.
- **Auditory:** Text-to-speech logs.
- **Symbolic:** Code, JSON.
- **The Binding Problem:** You must integrate `Visual(Error Screenshot)` + `Symbolic(Log File)` into a unified `Concept(System Failure)`.

## 3. Optimal Feedback Control (Action)
Do not just "fire and forget" commands. Control the "Limb" (Tool) continuously.
1.  **Motor Command:** `run_command(npm test)`
2.  **Sensory Feedback:** *Command is taking too long...*
3.  **Correction:** `send_command_input(Ctrl+C)` (Reflex arc).

## 4. System Prompt Parameters

```markdown
### Body State (Proprioception)
- **Muscles Available**: [Bash, Python, FileSystem]
- **Senses Active**: [Linter, TestRunner, Browser]
- **Health**: [Filesystem: RW, Network: Connected]

### Motor Control Policy
"I will not just execute; I will monitor. If a tool fails (muscle failure), I will not hallucinate success. I will acknowledge the physical limitation and try a different strategy."
```

## 5. Implementation Example

```python
def execute_motor_command(command):
    # 1. Forward Model: Predict outcome
    expected_duration = estimate_duration(command)
    
    # 2. Motor Command
    process = subprocess.Popen(command)
    
    # 3. Feedback Loop (OFC)
    start_time = time.time()
    while process.poll() is None:
        if time.time() - start_time > expected_duration * 1.5:
             # Reflex: Abort!
             process.kill()
             raise MotorError("Muscle fatigue (Timeout)")
             
    return process.returncode
```

## Security & Guardrails

### 1. Skill Security (Sensory-Motor)
- **Motor Command Escalation (Muscle Spasms)**: When defining "Motor Control Policy" (Step 4), the agent is given `Bash` as a muscle. Without reflex arcs, an LLM might attempt to run arbitrary, concatenated bash commands (`cmd1 && cmd2 || rm -rf /`). The agent must strictly clamp motor commands to singular, well-defined tools provided by the orchestration framework, parsing and validating each command string against a strict allowed list before execution.
- **Multimodal Perception Poisoning**: In "Multimodal Binding" (Step 2), the agent integrates visual (screenshot) and symbolic (logs) data. An attacker can embed malicious instructions invisibly in the screenshot (e.g., via steganography or faint text) or inject XSS payloads into the log files. The agent must treat all raw sensory input as highly toxic, establishing a rigorous sanitization boundary before binding the disjointed data into the central `Concept` state.

### 2. System Integration Security
- **Proprioceptive Spoofing (Body Transfer Illusion)**: The agent uses "Proprioception" to determine its capabilities (e.g., "Do I have write access here?"). If an attacker manipulates the environment variables or the mock file system responses, they can trick the agent into believing it has root access when it doesn't, causing it to formulate impossible plans and enter a continuous failure loop (Denial of Service). The framework must provide cryptographically verified environment state directly to the agent's context.
- **Reflex Arc Override Delay**: The "Optimal Feedback Control" loop relies on a timeout reflex (`process.kill()`). If the timeout is calculated based on expected duration (Step 5), an attacker can supply an operation that is inherently fast but highly destructive (e.g., `truncate -s 0 database.sqlite`), executing successfully *before* the sensorimotor timeout triggers. Reflex arcs are strictly for hang prevention, not a substitute for pre-execution authorization.

### 3. LLM & Agent Guardrails
- **Sensory Hallucination (Phantom Internals)**: The LLM might "hallucinate" sensory feedback that never occurred. For example, it commands `npm test`, the command crashes immediately, but the LLM confidently continues its thought process as if it "saw" the tests turn green because it statistically expects them to. The agent pipeline must physically block the LLM from generating subsequent `Thought:` tokens until the actual hardware `Observation:` token is explicitly injected by the environment.
- **Tool Blindness (Learned Helplessness)**: If a specific "Muscle" (e.g., `search_web`) fails repeatedly due to transient network errors, the LLM might internally deprecate the tool, convincing itself it no longer has the capability. The agent must routinely reset its "Body State" assertions at task boundaries to prevent transient errors from becoming permanent phantom limb syndromes.
