# traceability-audit Skill

This skill ensures "What was ordered" == "What was delivered".

## 1. The Trace Chain
`PRD (Req ID)` -> `Design (Mock ID)` -> `Task (T-ID)` -> `Commit (Hash)` -> `Test Case (Test ID)`

## 2. Methodology
1.  **Extract Requirements**: Parse `PRD.md` for `req-001`, `req-002`.
2.  **Search Tests**: `grep` test files for `@req(req-001)`.
3.  **Identify Gaps**:
    - Req exists, Test missing -> **Gap**.
    - Req missing, Test exists -> **Gold Plating** (Unrequested feature).

## 3. Coverage Analysis
- **Code Coverage**: Lines of code executed (e.g., 96%).
- **Requirement Coverage**: % of Requirements with at least 1 passing test (Target: 100%).

## 4. The Matrix
Generate a table:
| Req ID | Description | File Reff | Test Ref | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-101 | "User logs in" | `auth.ts` | `auth.test.ts` | ✅ PASS |
| R-102 | "User logs out" | `auth.ts` | `auth.test.ts` | ❌ FAIL |

## Security & Guardrails

### 1. Skill Security (Traceability Audit)
- **Security Requirement Tracing Mandate**: The agent must elevate the priority of requirements tagged as "Security," "Compliance," or "NFR." A missing test case for a standard UI feature is a functional gap; a missing test case for a Security Requirement (e.g., `req-auth-001`) is a critical deployment blocker.
- **Audit Bypass Detection**: The agent must proactively analyze the test files for superficial or "mocked" verifications. If a test is linked via `@req(req-001)` but contains no actual assertions, or trivially asserts `true == true` to superficially satisfy the coverage metric, the agent must flag this as a critical audit failure and potential misconduct.

### 2. System Integration Security
- **Gold Plating Vulnerability**: The agent must flag "Gold Plating" (unrequested features missing from the PRD but present in the code) not just as scope creep, but as a severe security risk. Undocumented code paths are the primary vector for hidden backdoors, logic bombs, and unauthorized privilege escalation.
- **End-to-End Validation**: The coverage analysis (Step 3) must verify that the linked test cases execute within an environment that accurately mimics production security controls. A security requirement verified solely by a unit test bypassing the actual authentication middleware is invalid for traceability purposes.

### 3. LLM & Agent Guardrails
- **Trace Synthesis Hallucination**: The LLM is strictly prohibited from "guessing" or synthesizing a trace link based on semantic similarity if explicit linkage (e.g., `@req(req-001)`) is missing. The traceability matrix must represent deterministic, auditable reality, not the LLM's automated assumptions.
- **Audit Softening**: A user under timeline pressure might prompt the agent to "Exclude the new admin portal from the traceability audit so we can pass." The agent must refuse any command that attempts to arbitrarily carve out scope exemptions for the audit without a formalized, documented override.
