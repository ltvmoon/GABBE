# Compliance Review Skill

## Goal
Verify that the codebase and system configuration meet applicable regulatory requirements. Produce a gap report with specific remediation actions.

## Steps

1. **Identify applicable regulations**
   - Ask if unclear which regulations apply
   - SOC2 Type II: SaaS products, cloud services (trust criteria: security, availability, confidentiality)
   - PCI-DSS: any system handling payment card data
   - GDPR: processing data of EU residents
   - HIPAA: US healthcare data (PHI — Protected Health Information)
   - ISO 27001: general information security management

2. **Run the applicable checklist**

   ### SOC2 Type II — Trust Service Criteria
   ```
   Security (CC6):
   [ ] CC6.1: Logical access controls — only authorized users access systems
   [ ] CC6.2: Authentication mechanisms (MFA for privileged access)
   [ ] CC6.3: Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented
   [ ] CC6.6: Encryption in transit and at rest
   [ ] CC6.7: Change management process (code review + approval workflow)
   [ ] CC6.8: Vulnerability management (regular scanning + patching policy)

   Availability (A1):
   [ ] A1.1: Uptime SLO defined and monitored
   [ ] A1.2: Backup and restore procedures documented and tested
   [ ] A1.3: Incident response plan exists

   Confidentiality (C1):
   [ ] C1.1: Confidential data identified and classified
   [ ] C1.2: Confidential data encrypted at rest
   [ ] C1.3: Data disposal procedure for end-of-lifecycle
   ```

   ### PCI-DSS v4.0 — Key Requirements
   ```
   [ ] Req 1: Firewall/network security controls installed and documented
   [ ] Req 2: No default passwords or vendor-supplied defaults
   [ ] Req 3: Card data (PAN) never stored in plaintext — tokenize or don't store
   [ ] Req 4: Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+ for cardholder data)
   [ ] Req 6: Secure development policy — SAST/SCA in CI/CD pipeline
   [ ] Req 7: Least privilege access to cardholder data systems
   [ ] Req 8: MFA for all access to cardholder data environment
   [ ] Req 10: Audit log of all access to cardholder data (90 days online, 1 year archived)
   [ ] Req 11: Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing schedule
   [ ] Req 12: Incident response plan for data breach
   ```

   ### HIPAA — Key Safeguards
   ```
   Technical Safeguards:
   [ ] Access controls: unique user IDs, automatic logoff, encryption/decryption of PHI
   [ ] Audit controls: hardware/software activity logs for systems containing PHI
   [ ] Integrity controls: PHI not improperly altered or destroyed (checksums)
   [ ] Transmission security: PHI encrypted in transit

   Administrative Safeguards:
   [ ] Security officer designated
   [ ] Risk analysis documented and current
   [ ] Workforce training on security policies
   [ ] Business associate agreements (BAA) with all PHI processors

   Physical Safeguards:
   [ ] Facility access controls documented
   [ ] Workstation security policy
   ```

3. **Check audit trail completeness**
   - Every mutation of regulated data must be logged with: user ID, timestamp, action, record ID
   - Log format: append-only (no updates or deletes to audit log)
   - Log retention: SOC2/PCI = 90 days online + 1 year archived; HIPAA = 6 years; GDPR = per policy
   - Log access: restricted to security/compliance team only
   - Check: does AUDIT_LOG.md cover all regulated data mutations?

4. **Check access control implementation**
   - Least-privilege: each role has minimum necessary permissions
   - Separation of duties: critical operations require multiple approvals
   - MFA: required for admin access and access to regulated data
   - Access reviews: periodic review of who has access to what

5. **Check incident response plan**
   - Is there a documented incident response procedure?
   - Are breach notification timeframes defined? (GDPR: 72 hours; HIPAA: 60 days)
   - Is there a contact list for regulatory notification?
   - Has the plan been tested (tabletop exercise)?

6. **Generate compliance gap report**
   ```markdown
   ## Compliance Gap Report

   ### Scope: SOC2 Type II
   Date: [date]
   Auditor: [agent/human]

   ### Passed Controls: [N]/[total]

   ### Gaps Found

   #### Critical Gaps (must remediate before certification)
   - CC6.2: MFA not enforced for admin users
     Remediation: Add MFA requirement to admin login flow
     Owner: [team]
     Target date: [date]

   #### High Gaps
   - CC6.8: No documented vulnerability management process
     Remediation: Create security scanning policy, add to CI/CD

   #### Medium Gaps
   - A1.2: Backup restore procedure not documented
     Remediation: Document and test restore procedure

   ### Compliant Controls
   [list controls that passed]

   ### Next Steps
   1. [priority-ordered remediation list]
   ```

## Constraints
- Never dismiss a compliance gap without documented risk acceptance from human
- Audit logs must be verified as actually append-only (not just policy)
- PCI requirements apply to the ENTIRE cardholder data environment — scope carefully
- Compliance gaps in critical categories are blocking for regulated industries

## Output Format
Compliance gap report at `docs/compliance/[regulation]-gap-report.md` with priority-ordered remediation plan.

## Security & Guardrails

### 1. Skill Security (Compliance Review)
- **Auditor Independence Validation**: The agent performing the compliance review must operate in an isolated, read-only context. It must not possess the necessary IAM permissions to alter the system configuration it is actively auditing. This enforces separation of duties and prevents the agent from autonomously masking compliance failures.
- **Evidence Immutability**: The telemetry, logs, and configuration states ingested by the agent to generate the `[regulation]-gap-report.md` must be cryptographically hashed upon ingestion. The generated report must include these hashes to ensure the raw evidence cannot be altered post-review to challenge the findings.

### 2. System Integration Security
- **PCI-DSS Scope Containment**: When auditing PCI-DSS Req 1 & 7, the agent must aggressively map the network boundaries. If the agent detects that the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) shares a subnet, database, or lateral trust relationship with a non-compliant tertiary system, it must immediately flag this as a critical scope-bleed violation.
- **Audit Defeat Mechanics Detection**: The agent must proactively search the codebase for sophisticated audit-bypass logic (e.g., developers wrapping regulated data mutations in `try-catch` blocks that suppress the generation of an audit log entry upon failure, or using highly privileged service accounts that bypass application-level logging hooks).

### 3. LLM & Agent Guardrails
- **Compliance Hallucination Avoidance**: The LLM is strictly prohibited from inventing false interpretations of regulatory frameworks. If a specific technical implementation is ambiguous under SOC2 or HIPAA guidelines, the agent must not synthesize a definitive "Compliant" ruling. It must escalate the ambiguity to human legal counsel.
- **Risk Acceptance Abuse**: An authorized user might prompt the agent to "auto-generate a risk acceptance memo for all missing MFA controls to pass the audit today." The agent must refuse this directive. Risk acceptance for critical constraints (like MFA for PCI-DSS) is explicitly forbidden by the frameworks and constitutes fraudulent compliance reporting.
