# Contributing to GABBE

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the GABBE Agentic Engineering Kit!

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreibesleaga/GABBE
cd GABBE
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest gabbe/tests/ scripts/tests/ -v
python3 agents/scripts/verify_use_cases.py
python3 agents/scripts/verify_triggers_and_mcps.py
```

---

## Adding a Custom Skill

1. Create a new `.skill.md` file in `agents/skills/<category>/`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does in one sentence
tags: [python, testing]
---
# My Skill

## Goal
Concise statement of what the agent should accomplish.

## Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Verify with tests

## Security & Guardrails
- Keep changes focused and secure
- Run tests after every change to prevent regressions
```

2. Re-run `init.py` to distribute the skill to all configured AI tools:

```bash
python3 scripts/init.py
```

3. Add a row to the skills table in `README_FULL.md` and an entry in `README.md`.

---

## Adding a Custom Template

1. Create a `.md` file in `agents/templates/<category>/`.
2. Use existing templates as reference (e.g., `agents/templates/core/TASKS_TEMPLATE.md`).
3. Update the templates table in `README.md` and `README_FULL.md`.

---

## Adding a Custom Guide

1. Create a `.md` file in `agents/guides/`.
2. Update the guides table in `README.md` (Guides by Stack section) and `README_FULL.md`.

---

## Code Changes to `gabbe/`

- All changes must pass `pytest gabbe/tests/ scripts/tests/ -v`.
- If you add a CLI feature, add or extend unit tests in `gabbe/tests/`.
- If you change `scripts/init.py`, add or extend tests in `scripts/tests/`.
- Run `python3 agents/scripts/verify_use_cases.py` and `verify_triggers_and_mcps.py` after skill/guide/template changes.
- Follow the existing code style (PEP 8, no type annotations required but welcomed).
- Add new configurable constants to `config.py` rather than hardcoding them.

### Key architectural rules
- `config.py` is the single source of truth for all configurable values.
- Never use `shell=True` in `subprocess.run` — use `shlex.split()`.
- Always close DB connections with `try/finally` or a context manager.
- Use `_atomic_write()` from `sync.py` for any file writes that must be crash-safe.
