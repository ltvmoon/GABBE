# GABBE (Generative Architectural Brain Base Engine)
## Agentic Software R&D Engineering Kit

## Quick Reference

![GABBE Agentic Software R&D Engineering Kit](docs/assets/GABBE.png)

## What is this?

- Universal kit for Software and AI coding agents: Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Antigravity/Gemini, Codex.
- Drop-in context kit that turns any AI coding agent into a governed engineering team for developing software.
- Based on Software Engineering & Architecture Practices and Procedures.
- Works for any project type, new or existing, any language, any team size.
- **Write Once, Run Everywhere**: SKILLS for Cursor (`.mdc`), VS Code (`folder/skill`), Claude (`.skill.md`), Gemini.
- The system features an experimental **Meta-Cognitive Orchestrator "Brain"** (Neurocognitive based architecture derived from Neuroscience, Cognitive Psychology, Epistemology, treating the Software System not as a machine, but as a **Cognitive Entity**), using Active Inference to plan, route, and optimize work.
- The system features a **Multi-Agent Swarm "Loki" Engineering Team** (30+ specialized agent roles for large projects), providing episodic and semantic memory, project history auditing and checkpoints.
- It has experimental support for budget enforcement, tokens, hard stops, policy rules, cli tool gateway (via MCP server), audit tracing and logs, human escalation, and deterministic replay.


It provides:
- **120+ Skills** (specialized capabilities)
- **60+ Templates** (standardized documents)
- **30+ Guides** (language & domain expertise)
- **30+ Personas** (specialized roles)
- **Brain Mode** (meta-cognitive orchestration)
- **Loki Mode** (multi-agent swarm engineering team for large projects)

### ⚡ Automated Setup (Recommended)
The `init.py` script is a **Universal Skill Compiler**. It generates the correct formats for your AI tools:
- **Cursor**: Generates `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (Optimized with Globs)
- **VS Code / Copilot**: Generates `.github/skills/` with `config.json`
- **Claude Code**: Symlinks `.claude/skills` for instant updates
- **Gemini**: Wires up `.gemini/settings.json`

1. Run the Wizard
```bash
python3 scripts/init.py
```

2. **Verify Context**
   - Open `agents/AGENTS.md` and check the `Tech Stack` section and other [PLACEHOLDER] or Optional sections.
   - Open `agents/CONSTITUTION.md` and review project laws.

3. **Feed the Mission**
   - The script generates `BOOTSTRAP_MISSION.md` (or `SETUP_MISSION.md` if dynamic setup is disabled) in your root.
   - **Copy its content** and paste it into your AI Agent's chat window.
   - This aligns the agent with your project context immediately.

4. **Git Tracking**
   - If you want to keep the initial structure of `agents/memory/` and `project/` in your repository but prevent Git from tracking the continuous autonomous modifications your agents will make to them locally, run:
     ```bash
     git ls-files agents/memory/ project/ | xargs git update-index --skip-worktree
     ```

**Manual Setup:**
```bash
cp -r GABBE/agents .
chmod +x agents/setup-context.sh && agents/setup-context.sh
```

### 🌍 Cross-Platform Support
- **Linux / macOS / WSL:** Native support.
- **Windows (Native):**
  - Use `python scripts/init.py` (Symlinks automatically fallback to file copies if needed).
  - Use `agents/scripts/setup-context.ps1` instead of `.sh`.

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Active Inference** | Predict → Act → Observe → Compare → Adapt loop |
| **Cost Routing** | Simple tasks → local free models, complex → remote SOTA |
| **Episodic Memory** | Recalls past project outcomes to avoid repeated mistakes |
| **System 2 Thinking** | Strategic planning before execution |

## 📊 Memory Architecture

| Layer | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Project State** | `agents/memory/PROJECT_STATE.md` | Current SDLC phase |
| **Audit Log** | `agents/memory/AUDIT_LOG.md` | Append-only decision history |
| **Continuity** | `agents/memory/CONTINUITY.md` | Past failures (read every session) |
| **Episodic** | `agents/memory/episodic/` | Per-session decision logs |
| **Semantic** | `agents/memory/semantic/` | Crystallized project knowledge |

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Agent ignores AGENTS.md | Run `setup-context.sh` to create symlinks |
| Agent repeats mistakes | Check `CONTINUITY.md` — tell agent to read it |
| Tests pass immediately | False positive — test is broken, fix it first |
| Uses deprecated APIs | Activate Context-7 MCP |
| Session lost | `"Use session-resume skill to load all memory"` |
| Context too large | Use `context_cost: low` skills or activate Loki Mode |

## 🛡️ Security & Guardrails

All 120+ skills in the GABBE kit feature a heavily enforced **"Security & Guardrails"** section that binds agents to the project's CONSTITUTION.md. The 3-layer security constraints include:

1.  **Skill Security**: Tool-specific protection (e.g., preventing command injection or sandbox escapes).
2.  **System Integration Security**: Safe external integration (e.g., verifying boundary enforcement or ensuring test coverage).
3.  **LLM/Agent Guardrails**: Protection from AI-specific failures (e.g., hallucinated metrics, confirmation bias, or prompt injection).

Agents are explicitly configured to **Fail-Closed**—they must wait for human approval rather than bypassing a guardrail.

## 🚀 GABBE CLI (Experimental)

GABBE has also an experimental helper, **Zero-Dependency CLI** (`gabbe`) for a "Hybrid Mode" (Markdown files and a SQLite database) and launching different commands. It is a work-in-progress and you can do without it, only with the rest of the kit.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- **LLM API Key**: For Brain/Route features, set `GABBE_API_KEY` (OpenAI-compatible).

**Environment Variables** (full reference in [CLI_REFERENCE.md](docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md)):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GABBE_API_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `GABBE_API_KEY` | *(required for LLM features)* | Bearer token for the LLM API |
| `GABBE_API_MODEL` | `gpt-4o` | Model name sent in API requests |
| `GABBE_LLM_TEMPERATURE` | `0.7` | Sampling temperature (0.0–1.0) |
| `GABBE_LLM_TIMEOUT` | `30` | HTTP timeout in seconds |
| `GABBE_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Number of LLM retry attempts on transient errors |
| `GABBE_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) |
| `GABBE_ROUTE_THRESHOLD` | `50` | Complexity score above which prompts route REMOTE |
| `GABBE_MAX_COST_USD` | `5.0` | Maximum cost (USD) budget per run |
| `GABBE_MAX_TOKENS_PER_RUN` | `100000` | Maximum token limit per run |
| `GABBE_MAX_TOOL_CALLS_PER_RUN` | `50` | Maximum tool calls allowed per run |
| `GABBE_MAX_ITERATIONS` | `25` | Maximum active-inference iterations per run |
| `GABBE_MAX_WALL_TIME` | `300` | Maximum wall-clock time (seconds) per run |
| `GABBE_MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH` | `5` | Maximum agent recursion depth |
| `GABBE_MAX_RETRIES_PER_TOOL` | `3` | Maximum retries for a single tool call |
| `GABBE_POLICY_FILE` | `project/policies.yml` | Path to the YAML policy file |
| `GABBE_ESCALATION_MODE` | `cli` | Escalation mode: `cli`, `file`, or `silent` |
| `GABBE_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Timeout (seconds) for verify sub-commands |
| `GABBE_OTEL_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable OpenTelemetry tracing |

### Installation
The CLI is a Python package.

```bash
# 1. Install locally (Recommended)
pip install -e .

# 2. Verify installation
gabbe --help
```

### Core Commands
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `gabbe init` | Initialize the SQLite Database (Run this after `python scripts/init.py`). |
| `gabbe sync` | **Hybrid Sync**: Bidirectional sync between `project/TASKS.md` and SQLite DB. |
| `gabbe verify`| **Enforcer**: programmable integrity check (files, tests, lint). |
| `gabbe status`| **Dashboard**: Visualizes project phase and task progress. |
| `gabbe brain` | **Meta-Cognition**: Activates Active Inference loop or Evolutionary Prompt Optimization (Requires API Key). |
| `gabbe route` | **Cost Router**: Arbitrates between Local and Remote LLMs based on task complexity (Requires API Key). |
| `gabbe forecast`| **Strategic Forecast**: Projects remaining work cost and tokens based on historical run data. |
| `gabbe serve-mcp` | **MCP Gateway**: Zero-dependency JSON-RPC Model Context Protocol server for standalone agents to access tools safely. |
| `gabbe runs` | **Run History**: List recent agent runs with status, cost, and timestamps. |
| `gabbe audit <run-id>` | **Audit Trace**: Display structured span-level trace for a past run (`--format json\|table`). |
| `gabbe replay <run-id>` | **Deterministic Replay**: Replay a past run from its checkpoints (`--from-step N`). |
| `gabbe resume <run-id>` | **Escalation Resume**: Approve or reject pending escalations for a paused run. |

### Platform Control Layer
The experimental `gabbe` CLI supports a **platform control layer**. It covers budget enforcement, cost and token controls, hard stops, policy rules, the tool gateway, audit tracing, human escalation, and deterministic replay. Detailed documentation is available in [`PLATFORM_CONTROLS.md`](docs/PLATFORM_CONTROLS.md).

### Architecture
GABBE uses a **Hybrid Architecture** where agents and humans interact via Markdown, but the system of record is SQLite.

### How to Use

#### Setup
```bash
# 1. Generate Context Configs
python3 scripts/init.py

# 2. Initialize Database
gabbe init
```

#### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Check status
gabbe status

# Sync tasks (manual edits)
gabbe sync

# Optimize a skill (Requires GABBE_API_KEY)
gabbe brain evolve --skill tdd-cycle
```

#### Verification
```bash
gabbe verify
```
